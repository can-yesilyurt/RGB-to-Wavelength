# ReverseColorSearch-Algorithm
A search algorithm coded in Wolfram, that can be used to predict wavelength values in visible spectrum for a given RGB values.

It is straightforward to calculate RGB values for a given wavelength in the visible spectrum. However, there is no deterministic analytical solution for the other way around, i.e., if one need to find the wavelength for a given color in RGB. This is because some information is lost while mapping the visible spectrum to RGB color scheme. Here, an algorithm similar to gravitational search algorithm is implemented for the aforomentioned task.
